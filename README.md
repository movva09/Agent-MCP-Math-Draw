# MCP based Math Drawing Client

The Math Drawing Client (`talk2mcp_math_draw_client.py`) is a Python application that combines mathematical computations with visual drawing capabilities. It uses the Gemini AI model to process mathematical queries and generate appropriate responses.

## Features

### Currently Implemented Features
- Integration with Gemini AI for mathematical problem-solving
- Drawing capabilities for visual representation of mathematical results
- Iterative problem-solving approach (max 9 iterations)
- Support for basic mathematical operations and ASCII value calculations
- Automatic drawing of results on a canvas
- Basic error handling and recovery
- Simple canvas operations
- Basic text placement
- Timeout handling for operations (10-second timeout for LLM operations)
- Session management
- Tool execution with parameter validation

2. Server Configuration:
   - Port configuration (default: 8080)
   - Memory allocation for mathematical operations
   - Canvas size settings (default: 1920x1080)
   - Maximum concurrent connections
   - Timeout settings for operations

3. Server Tools:
   - Mathematical computation engine
   - Drawing canvas manager
   - Tool execution handler
   - Session manager
   - Error handling system

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
  - `python-dotenv`
  - `google-generativeai`
  - `mcp` package

## Environment Setup
1. Create a `.env` file in the project root
2. Add your Gemini API key:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Server Setup
1. Install server dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install mcp google-generativeai python-dotenv
   ```

2. Configure server settings in `config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "server": {
       "port": 8080,
       "max_connections": 10,
       "timeout": 30,
       "canvas": {
         "width": 1920,
         "height": 1080
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Start the MCP server:
   ```bash
   python example2-3_server.py
   ```

## Available Tools

### Currently Implemented Tools
1. Mathematical Operations:
   - Basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
   - Advanced mathematical functions (exponential, logarithmic)
   - ASCII value calculations
   - String manipulation and conversion
   - Array operations
   - Prime number calculations
   - Factorial computations
   - Fibonacci sequence generation

2. Drawing Tools:
   - Rectangle drawing with custom dimensions
   - Basic text placement with formatting
   - Canvas clearing and reset
   - Coordinate-based drawing
   - Simple color selection
   - Basic layer management

### Planned Future Tools
1. Enhanced Mathematical Operations
2. Advanced Drawing Features:
3. Analysis Tools:
4. Utility Tools:

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install python-dotenv google-generativeai mcp
   ```
3. Set up your environment variables as described above

## Usage
1. Start the MCP server (see Server Setup section)
2. Ensure the server is running and accessible
3. Run the client:
   ```bash
   python talk2mcp_math_draw_client.py
   ```

## Server-Client Communication
1. Connection Protocol:
   - Client establishes connection with server
   - Authentication handshake
   - Tool list synchronization
   - Session initialization

2. Data Flow:
   - Client sends mathematical queries
   - Server processes requests
   - Results are returned to client
   - Drawing commands are executed
   - Status updates are communicated

3. Error Handling:
   - Connection retry mechanism
   - Session recovery
   - Tool execution fallback
   - Resource cleanup

## Example Queries
1. Basic Mathematical Drawing:
```
Calculate the sum of ASCII values for the word "HELLO" and draw it inside a rectangle at the center of the canvas.
```

2. Complex Mathematical Visualization:
```
Find the exponential values of first 5 prime numbers, sum them up, and display the result in a blue rectangle at coordinates (500, 300).
```

3. Multiple Operations:
```
Convert the word "MATH" to ASCII values, calculate their sum, find the square root, and display the result in a red rectangle with white text.
```

4. Advanced Drawing:
```
Draw a rectangle at (200, 200) with width 400 and height 300, then place the result of (2^10 + 3^5) inside it with centered text.
```

## How It Works
1. The client connects to the MCP server using stdio communication
2. It processes mathematical queries using the Gemini AI model
3. Results are automatically drawn on a canvas
4. The system uses an iterative approach (max 9 iterations) to solve complex problems
5. Results are displayed in a visually appealing format
6. Each operation is validated against tool schemas
7. Error handling and timeout mechanisms are in place

## Error Handling
The client includes robust error handling for:
- API timeouts (10-second timeout for LLM operations)
- Invalid inputs
- Connection issues
- Tool execution errors
- Drawing tool failures
- Parameter validation errors
- Session management issues
